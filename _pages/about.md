## Profile
I am a research-oriented graduate student specializing in **Computer Vision**, **Natural Language Processing**, and **Multimodal Learning**. My work includes developing deep learning models for image recognition, emotion analysis, object detection, and LLM post-training. I am proficient in **Python**, **PyTorch**, **OpenCV**, and have strong experience in research projects, dataset construction, and model optimization.

## Research Projects

### **Do LLMs Think Like the Brain? Neural Predictivity and Anatomical Alignment in Narrative Comprehension**  
**Feb 2025 – May 2025**  
*Skills: Text data processing, LLM fine-tuning, embedding analysis*

- Fine-tuned large language models to align with cognitive tasks related to narrative comprehension.  
- Extracted embeddings from 16 different models and evaluated inter-model similarities using CKA metrics.


### **A Multimodal Assessment Model and Intervention Study of Student Participation in Collaborative Learning**  
**Oct 2022 – Sep 2024**  
*Skills: Video-based classification, long-tail data*

- Collected and labeled classroom video/audio data using custom annotation tools; performed hardware calibration for camera systems.  
- Built facial detection and recognition pipelines using YOLOv8 and InsightFace.  
- Proposed a spatial–temporal emotion monitoring framework using GS-convolution multi-scale features and a frame sequence predictor, achieving **67.5% accuracy on the DFEW dataset**.


### **Third Place – iFLYTEK Algorithm Challenge (Autonomous Driving & Driver Fatigue Detection)**  
**May 2022 – Jun 2022**  
*Skills: Image classification, facial detection*

- Applied data augmentation to address class imbalance and improve robustness.  
- Trained EfficientNetB7 with Progressive Self-Knowledge Distillation (PS-KD).  
- Used Test-Time Augmentation (TTA), achieving **99.967% accuracy**.
